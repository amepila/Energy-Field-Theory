    "Dc-dc converters are power electronic circuits that convert a dc voltage to a different dc voltage level, often providing a regulated output. The circuits described in this section are classified as switched-mode dc-dc converters, also called switching power supplies or switchers. This section describes some basic dc-dc converter circuits. Also it will be described some common variations of these circuits that are used in many dc power supply designs."

    "## Converter Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of a power electronics circuit is to match the voltage and current requirements\n",
    "of the load to those of the source. Power electronics circuits convert one type or level of a voltage or current waveform to another and are hence called converters. Converters serve as an interface between the source and load (Fig. 01001).\n",

    "> __ac input/dc output__\n",
    "The ac-dc converter produces a dc output from an ac input. Average power is transferred from an ac source to a dc load. The ac-dc converter is specifically classified as a rectifier. For example, an ac-dc converter enables integrated circuits to operate from a  $60 \\mathrm{Hz}$ ac line voltage by converting the ac signal to a dc signal of the appropriate voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __dc input/ac output__\n",
    "    The dc-ac converter is specifically classified as an inverter. In the inverter, average power flows from the dc side to the ac side. Examples of inverter applications include producing a $120 \\mathrm{V}$ rms $60 \\mathrm{Hz}$ voltage from a $12 \\mathrm{V}$ battery and interfacing an alternative energy source such as an array of solar cells to an electric utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __dc input/dc output__\n",
    "The dc-dc converter is useful when a load requires a specified (often regulated) dc voltage or current but the source is at a different or unregulated dc value. For example, $5 \\mathrm{V}$ may be obtained from a $12 \\mathrm{V}$ source via a dc-dc converter.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __ac input/ac output__\n",
    "The ac-ac converter may be used to change the level and/or frequency of an ac signal. Examples include a common light-dimmer circuit and speed control of an induction motor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some converter circuits can operate in different modes, depending on circuit and control parameters. For example, some rectifier circuits can be operated as inverters by modifying the control on the semiconductor devices. In such cases, it is the direction of average power flow that determines the converter classification. In Fig. 01002, if the battery is charged from the ac power source, the converter is classified as a rectifier. If the operating parameters of the converter are changed and the battery acts as a source supplying power to the ac system, the converter\n",
    "is then classified as an inverter.\n",

    "To illustrate some concepts in power electronics, consider the design problem of creating a $3\\mathrm{V}$ de voltage level from a $9\\mathrm{V}$ battery. The purpose is to supply $3 \\mathrm{V}$ to a load resistance. One simple solution is to use a voltage divider, as shown in Fig. 01004. For a load resistor $R_{L},$ inserting a series resistance of $2 R_{L}$ results in $3 \\mathrm{V}$ across $R_{L} .$ A problem with this solution is that the power absorbed by the $2 R_{L}$ resistor is twice as much as delivered to the load and is lost as heat, making the circuit only $33.3$ percent efficient. Another problem is that if the value of the load resistance changes, the output voltage will change unless the $2 R_{L}$ resistance changes proportionally. A solution to that problem could be to use a transistor in place of the $2 R_{L}$ resistance. The transistor would be controlled such that the voltage across it is maintained at $6 \\mathrm{V}$, thus regulating the output at $3 \\mathrm{V}$. However, as will be demostrated, the same low-efficiency problem is encountered with this solution.\n",

The base current can be adjusted to compensate for variations in the supply voltage or the load, thus regulating the output. This type of circuit is called a __linear dc-dc converter__ or a __linear regulator__ because the transistor operates in the linear region, rather than in the saturation or cutoff regions. The transistor in effect operates as a variable resistance.\n",

    "While this may be a simple way of converting a dc supply voltage to a lower dc voltage and regulating the output, the low efficiency of this circuit is a serious drawback for power applications, as it was discused beofre. The power absorbed by the load is $V_{o} I_{L},$ and the power absorbed by the transistor is $V_{C E} I_{L},$ assuming a small base current. The power loss in the transistor makes this circuit inefficient. For one more example, if the output voltage is one-quarter of the input voltage, the load resistor absorbs one-quarter of the source power, which is an efficiency of $25$ percent. The transistor absorbs the other $75$ percent of the power supplied by the source. It is easy to realize than lower output voltages result in even lower efficiencies. Therefore, the linear voltage regulator is suitable only for low-power applications."
