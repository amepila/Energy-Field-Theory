    "This article will explain how vector control works in a friendly and harmless way. However, first we need to clarify what we mean by control when discussing motor drives:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## To control or not to control\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine walking your dog, Firulais, in the park. You have a leash attached to Firulais, so he may snoop around as he like to the extent of his leash. Ever so, he will follow approximately the same route as you are walking. You might think that you have your dog under control, right? Well, not so much. This scenario would be referred to as Scalar Control in the domain of motor drives. \n",

    "Scalar control means that the motor is not being controlled exactly, but there exist a pretty good idea about what it is doing. The inverter is supplying the electric motor with a voltage and a frequency, and the motor will respond to that input much as Firulais in a leash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's glue Firulais on to a skateboard and replace the leash with a steel rod. Firulais will now move exactly as you want him to, inch by inch. **This is Vector Control.** For a motor drive, it means that the controller knows the position of the rotor at any time, and t will create a new magnetic field to push the rotor in the desired direction several hundred (or thousand) times every second. Scalar Control on the other hand, has no idea about the rotor position and only provides the motor with a speed set point to which the motor has to follow as well as it can, given load variances and other disturbances.\n",

    "## Revealing the rotor magnetic field\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of vector control is obtaining the position of the rotor. By position It do not mean that the rotor is physically located inside the stator, but in which direction the rotor's magnetic field is pointing. When an induction machine (IM) is magnetized, there are induced (doh) voltages and currents in the rotor which sets up magnetic fields. Summing up all the current's magnetic fields, there will be a NET field which is pointing in a given direction. This direction is important as it dictates where the inverter should place the stator magnetic field in order to further push the rotor around. \n",
    "\n",
    "For permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSM), the magnetic field is more or less given by the rotor magnets and stays constant most of the time (field weakening could be performed, but such think will be explained in other article). It nevertheless has to be determined, and that is performed in the same way for both induction machines and PMSMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual direction of the magnetic field is given by the motor's electro motive force (EMF) which is induced on to the stator windings by the rotor field. This EMF will behave as a voltage source connected in series with the rotor resistance/leakage inductance and in parallel to the magnetizing inductance.  If the motor's parameters are known (stator/rotor resistance and magnetizing inductance, among others), it is possible to estimate the value of the EMF. This value is a vector, that is, it has a magnitude and a direction which is pointing the same way as the rotor's net magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "This direction is used when the controller is going to plot the magnetic field in the stator. The stator field's purpose is to attract the rotor in the same way ordinary magnets attract each other. It is also possible to repulse the rotor, but in that case the magnetic field is employed behind the rotor instead, chasing it more or less the same way a dog would be chasing its tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above description does not fully cover the science of revealing the rotor's field direction. Further methods will be thoroughly explained in a separate article."

    "\n",
    "When the rotor's magnetic field has been determined, it is time to decide where to apply a proper magnetic field in order to further move the rotor in the desired direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that the rotor field is located at 90 degrees. This means that the North pole is pointing straight up (in a two poled machine, for sake of simplicity).  \n",
    "Now, where should the stator field needs to be placed in order to push the rotor in the desired direction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the main objective is to produce a torque, so the stator field needs to be placed in a direction where It get the most torque application on the rotor. It also do not want to pay more amperage than it absolutely have to. Current is a limited resource because inverter components are priced based on their current rating. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, it turns out that the highest torque per amp is achieved when the stator magnetic field is oriented perpendicularly to the rotor. In this case at either 180 or 0 degrees, depending on which direction has been selected to move the rotor. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is perfectly possible to align the stator field for example just 10 degrees away from the rotor field, but the torque produced will be much lower and the current is almost the same. Not a particularly good deal, so let's stick with 90 degrees' separation between the two fields."

    "\n",
    "Vector Control is a very common way to control an electric motor using current and voltage measurements. These measurements are used to determine the rotor position and calculate a new set of three-phased voltages which is applied to the motor terminals. This in turn will produce a new magnetic field that moves the rotor ever so slightly before a new measurement is taken an the process is repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The drive is trying to control two different types of current in an induction motor:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Reactive current used to create the magnetic field (n/a in PM machines)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Active current used to produce torque to turn the rotor\n",
    "\n",
    "* The reactive current is almost constant and is being controlled by the flux regulator. It is usually applied before any torque producing currents when starting the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If however field weakening is required, the reactive current is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The reactive current is about 25% to 35% of the nominal current of the machine. Hence, even with no speed or no torque, there will always be that amount of current present in the machine. Because the flux current is almost purely reactive, it is not be measurable on the DC-bus, or the line side of the inverter. It sill exists in the switches (transistors), but it cancels out on the DC side.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The active current is used to control either speed, power or torque. It is important to understand that whether the reference is in speed or power, it is still torque that is being controlled. e.g. if speed too slow: apply more torque. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Torque is given directly by the amount of active current. Which again is given by voltage:\n",
    "    Higher voltage -> more current -> more torque -> increased speed and/or power.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When controlling the machine, the drive has to know where the rotor is. That is, in which direction the flux in the rotor is \"pointing\". This has to be estimated by using mathematical models and measurements of voltage and current. It can also be given by an encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Variable Speed Drive (VSD) is controlling the motor by applying the voltage vector relative to the rotor flux vector. If we imagine the machine as a clock, one can pretend that the rotor flux is pointing at the 1 o’clock position. The VSD then has to apply a voltage vector at 12 o’clock to set up a magnetic field in the stator to “chase” the rotor around. (In practical drives, the stator vector is normally positioned 90° ahead or behind the rotor vector as this gives maximum amount of torque per ampere)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above routine is being repeated over and over again very quickly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. Measure current and voltages\n",

    "> 2. Estimate rotor position based on above measurements and the voltage and/or current model.\n",

    "\n",
    "> 6. Start over\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Output voltage and frequency has to be changed proportionally. The amount of flux in the machine is given by the relationship between voltage and frequency $(\\mathrm{V} / \\mathrm{f})$. Because we want to keep the flux constant, it is required to change voltage and frequency linearly, i.e. 30% speed = 30% frequency = 30% voltage. The reason for this relationship is that the winding inductance’s reactance is frequency dependent; $X_{L}=2 \\pi f$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because the voltage in the motor is very low at low speeds (below 3 Hz), it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain good voltage measurements due to noise and resistive voltage drops in cables and windings. This makes it difficult to control the motor, and instead an encoder is required. With an encoder the VSD can control the motor accurately even at 0 Hz (for example keeping a load hanging still in a winch application)."

    "\n",
    "It can also be seen that every pattern starts and ends with a zero vector, and that between every transition, only one switch is being changed. This greatly reduces harmonics in the motor which cause overheating and torque fluctuations. Also, any current that is not contributing to torque, or is necessary to maintain the required magnetic field, is unwanted. This is because the losses in the power electronic components are current dependent and they translate to heat which will stress the cooling system. Over-heating of transistors and diodes are one of the main challenges when designing power electronics today. The alternative is to design a converter with higher current ratings, but this increases the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, at the bottom of the above figure two schematics are shown. These represent the state of the switches for the two basic vectors which are in use in the current section. The percentage indication above indicate their on-time relative to the other. For example, if the angle is exactly between to basic vectors (i.e. 30°), both basic vector would be turned on 50% of the time each. Please note that this percentage does not indicate their total on time with respect to the period T\n",
    ". If the voltage magnitude is less than maximum, there is added zero-vectors to averange down the voltage. So at 70% voltage magnitude and still at 30°, the ON-time of each basic vector is still 50% with respect to each other, but in total there would be 30% zero vectoring within this period. The actual on-time for each transistor thus become 35%;\n",

    "## Over modulation\n",
    "\n",
    "For modulation index beyond 1.154 strange things will start to happen. The control voltages used in conjunction with the triangular wave will move above the trig wave. This will effectively remove zero vectors and depending on how far above the control voltage moves, it will also dominate the other control voltages for longer and longer periods within each own sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverter will cut pulses and distort (roughen up) the sinusoidal wave more and more until a situation called six step occurs. In six step operation, the inverter will stay at one basic vector at the time and jump directly to the next basic vector and then to the next and so forth. With 60 degree steps and square wave operation, the motor will produce a lot for harmonics and probably feels really terrible. Luckily, the motor inductance will filter (smoothen) the current to avoid damage due to exessive cogging / torque ripple (common knowledge lets to state that, it is the current that produces the torque - not the voltage, but from more ample perspective, making reference to the Pointing vector´s concept, the torque is a manifesto of the physical system traveling energy but now via rotatory phenomena).\n",
    "\n",
    "such operation operation mode is exactly what has been being tried to avoid initially by doing the averging of two different and adjacent basic vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though over modulation seems like motor torture (which it is...), it is sometimes necessary. Up till now it has been assumed that the DC-link always stays at a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ above the supply voltage, but that is not always the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When high currents are needed, such as when the motor is running at full speed and full power, the current drawn from the grid is substantial, causing the small DC resistance in the rectifier diodes to become huge voltage drops (Ohm's law). \n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly the DC-link voltage is no longer 975 V, but 900 V and at full speed the motor requires full voltage in order to keep the motor flux at rated value. At this voltage, a modulation index of 1.25 is required, and this will create an ugly sine wave. Also, note that over-modulation is no longer linear. It actually looks more like the saturation region of a magnetizing curve, meaning that the controller will have to amplify the modulation index in order to achieve the desired (linearized) modulation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the ugly sine wave, harmonics other than the designed third harmonic start to appear. These can cause over heating of both rotor and main windings along with acoustic noise (cryings, whining and shrieks) and torque ripples.  Note that this applies to induction motors (PMSM). on the othe hand Brushless DC-machines (BLDC) are actually designed for this mode of operation, with trapezoidal counter-electromotive force (BEMF)"
