    "## Electric power \n",
    "It is the rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric power is usually produced by electric generators, but can also be supplied by sources such as electric batteries. It is usually supplied to businesses and homes (as domestic mains electricity) by the electric power industry through an electric power grid. Electric energy is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (1 kW·h = 3.6 MJ) which is the product of the power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. Electric utilities measure power using an electricity meter, which keeps a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer.\n",

    "Electrical power provides a low entropy form of energy and can be carried long distances and converted into other forms of energy such as motion, light or heat with high energy efficiency."

    "## Entropy\n",
    "In statistical mechanics, entropy is an extensive property of a thermodynamic system. It is closely related to the number $Ω$ of microscopic configurations (known as microstates) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy $S$ is the natural logarithm of the number of microstates $\\Omega$, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n",
    "\n",
    "$S=k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega$\n",

    "Entropy is a function of the state of the system, so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is reversible, the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of the lack of information about it. The concept of entropy plays a central role in information theory. "

    "## Dipole antenna\n",
    "\n",
    "In radio and telecommunications a dipole antenna or doublet is the simplest and most widely used class of antenna. The dipole is any one of a class of antennas producing a radiation pattern approximating that of an elementary electric dipole with a radiating structure supporting a line current so energized that the current has only one node at each end. A dipole antenna commonly consists of two identical conductive elements such as metal wires or rods. The driving current from the transmitter is applied, or for receiving antennas the output signal to the receiver is taken, between the two halves of the antenna. Each side of the feedline to the transmitter or receiver is connected to one of the conductors. This contrasts with a monopole antenna, which consists of a single rod or conductor with one side of the feedline connected to it, and the other side connected to some type of ground. A common example of a dipole is the \"rabbit ears\" television antenna found on broadcast television sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dipole is the simplest type of antenna from a theoretical point of view. Most commonly it consists of two conductors of equal length oriented end-to-end with the feedline connected between them. Dipoles are frequently used as resonant antennas. If the feedpoint of such an antenna is shorted, then it will be able to resonate at a particular frequency, just like a guitar string that is plucked. Using the antenna at around that frequency is advantageous in terms of feedpoint impedance (and thus standing wave ratio), so its length is determined by the intended wavelength (or frequency) of operation. The most commonly used is the center-fed half-wave dipole which is just under a half-wavelength long. The radiation pattern of the half-wave dipole is maximum perpendicular to the conductor, falling to zero in the axial direction, thus implementing an omnidirectional antenna if installed vertically, or (more commonly) a weakly directional antenna if horizontal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they may be used as standalone low-gain antennas, dipoles are also employed as driven elements in more complex antenna designs such as the Yagi antenna and driven arrays. Dipole antennas (or such designs derived from them, including the monopole) are used to feed more elaborate directional antennas such as a horn antenna, parabolic reflector, or corner reflector. Engineers analyze vertical (or other monopole) antennas on the basis of dipole antennas of which they are one half.\n",

    "Figure: A half-wave dipole antenna receiving a radio signal. The incoming radio wave <font color=\"green\">(whose Electric field is shown as $E$, green arrows)</font> causes an oscillating electric current within the antenna elements (black arrows), alternately charging the two sides of the antenna positively (+) and negatively (−). Since the antenna is one half a wavelength long at the radio wave's frequency, the voltage <font color=\"red\">(shown as V, red bands)</font> and current in the antenna form a standing wave. This oscillating current flows down the antenna's transmission line through the radio receiver (represented by resistor $R$).\n",
