    "The results of the following development are firs intriduced in [__The DC-DC Buck Converter Analisys Section__](https://github.com/Xiuhcoatl-013/Energy-Field-Theory/blob/master/notes/dc_dc_converters/buck_converter/buck_converter.ipynb) used in [__The Digital Control of High-Frequency Switched-Mode Power Converters Section__]() on the control for de power supplies. A general method for describing a circuit that changes over a switching period is called state-space averaging. The technique requires two sets of state equations which describe the circuit: one set for the switch closed and one set for the switch open. These state equations are then averaged over the switching period. A state-variable description of a system is of the form\n",
